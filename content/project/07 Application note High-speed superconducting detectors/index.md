title: "Application note: High-speed superconducting detectors"
summary: "(October 2021) Parallel-pixel detectors let you go beyond the speed limit set by the photon pile-up effect. In this application note, we explore how such a design is allowing IDQâ€™s ID281 SNSPDs to detect single photons faster than ever before."
