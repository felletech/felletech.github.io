abstract: We report on resonance fluorescence from a single quantum dot emitting at
  telecom wavelengths. We perform high-resolution spectroscopy and observe the Mollow
  triplet in the Rabi regimeâ€”a hallmark of resonance fluorescence. The measured resonance-fluorescence
  spectra allow us to rule out pure dephasing as a significant decoherence mechanism
  in these quantum dots. Combined with numerical simulations, the experimental results
  provide robust characterisation of charge noise in the environment of the quantum
  dot. Resonant control of the quantum dot opens up new possibilities for the on-demand
  generation of indistinguishable single photons at telecom wavelengths as well as
  quantum optics experiments and direct manipulation of solid-state qubits in telecom-wavelength
  quantum dots.
