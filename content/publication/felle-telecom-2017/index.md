abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are well established as sub-Poissonian
  sources of entangled photon pairs. To improve the utility of a QD light source,
  it would be advantageous to extend their emission further into the near infrared,
  into the low absorption wavelength windows utilised in long-haul optical telecommunication.
  Initial experiments succeeded in interfering O-band (1260—1360 nm) photons from
  an InAs/GaAs QD with dissimilar photons from a laser, an important mechanism for
  quantum teleportation. Interference visibilities as high as 60 ± 6 % were recorded,
  surpassing the 50 % threshold imposed by classical electrodynamics. Later, polarisation-entanglement
  of a similar QD was observed, with pairs of telecom-wavelength photons from the
  radiative cascade of the biexciton state exhibiting fidelities of 92.0 ± 0.2 % to
  the  Bell state.  Subsequently, an O-band telecom-wavelength quantum relay was realised.
  Again using an InAs/GaAs QD device, this represents the first implementation of
  a sub-Poissonian telecom-wavelength quantum relay, to the best knowledge of the
  author. The relay proved capable of implementing the famous four-state BB84 protocol,
  with a mean teleportation fidelity as high as 94.5 ± 2.2 %, which would contribute
  0.385 secure bits per teleported qubit. After characterisation by way of quantum
  process tomography, the performance of the relay was also evaluated to be capable
  of implementing a six-state QKD protocol.  In an effort to further extend the emitted
  light from a QD into the telecom C-band  (1530—1565 nm), alternative material systems
  were investigated. InAs QDs on a substrate of InP were shown to emit much more readily
  in the fibre-telecom O- and C-bands than their InAs/GaAs counterparts, largely due
  to the reduced lattice mismatch between the QD and substrate for InAs/InP (~3 %)
  compared to InAs/GaAs (~7 %). Additionally, to minimize the fine structure splitting
  (FSS) of the exciton level, which deteriorates the observed polarisation-entanglement,
  a new mode of dot growth was investigated. Known as droplet epitaxy (D-E), QDs grown
  in this mode showed a fourfold reduction in the FSS compared to dots grown in the
  Stranski-Krastanow mode. This improvement would allow observation of polarisation-entanglement
  in the telecom C-band. In subsequent work performed by colleagues at the Toshiba
  Cambridge Research Labs, these D-E QDs were embedded in a p-i-n doped optical cavity,
  processed with electrical contacts, and found to emit entangled pairs of photons
  under electrical excitation.  The work of this thesis provides considerable technological
  advances to the field of entangled-light sources, that in the near future may allow
  for deterministic quantum repeaters operating at megahertz rates, and in the further
  future could facilitate the distribution of coherent multipartite states across
  a distributed quantum network.
