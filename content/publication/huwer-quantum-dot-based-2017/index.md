abstract: The development of quantum relays for long-haul and attack-proof quantum
  communication networks operating with weak coherent laser pulses requires entangled
  photon sources at telecommunication wavelengths with intrinsic single-photon emission
  for most practical implementations. Using a semiconductor quantum dot emitting entangled
  photon pairs in the telecommunication O band, we demonstrate a quantum relay fulfilling
  both of these conditions. The system achieves a maximum fidelity of 94.5% for implementation
  of a standard four-state protocol with input states generated by a laser. We further
  investigate robustness against frequency detuning of the narrow-band input and perform
  process tomography of the teleporter, revealing operation for arbitrary pure input
  states, with an average gate fidelity of 83.6%. The results highlight the potential
  of semiconductor light sources for compact and robust quantum-relay technology that
  is compatible with existing communication infrastructures.
