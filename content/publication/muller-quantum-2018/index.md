abstract: Single photons and entangled photon pairs are a key resource of many quantum
  secure communication and quantum computation protocols, and non-Poissonian sources
  emitting in the low-loss wavelength region around 1,550 nm are essential for the
  development of fibre-based quantum network infrastructure. However, reaching this
  wavelength window has been challenging for semiconductor-based quantum light sources.
  Here we show that quantum dot devices based on indium phosphide are capable of electrically
  injected single photon emission in this wavelength region. Using the biexciton cascade
  mechanism, they also produce entangled photons with a fidelity of 87 ± 4%, sufficient
  for the application of one-way error correction protocols. The material system further
  allows for entangled photon generation up to an operating temperature of 93 K. Our
  quantum photon source can be directly integrated with existing long distance quantum
  communication and cryptography systems, and provides a promising material platform
  for developing future quantum network hardware.
