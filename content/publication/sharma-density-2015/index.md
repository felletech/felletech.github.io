abstract: Epitaxial InAs quantum dots grown on GaAs substrate are being used in several
  applications ranging from quantum communications to solar cells. The growth mechanism
  of these dots also helps us to explore fundamental aspects of self-organized processes.
  Here we show that composition and strain profile of the quantum dots can be tuned
  by controlling in-plane density of the dots over the substrate with the help of
  substrate-temperature profile. The compositional profile extracted from grazing
  incidence x-ray measurements show substantial amount of inter-diffusion of Ga and
  In within the QD as a function of height in the low-density region giving rise to
  higher variation of lattice parameters. The QDs grown with high in-plane density
  show much less spread in lattice parameter giving almost flat density of In over
  the entire height of an average QD and much narrower photoluminescence (PL) line.
  The results have been verified with three different amounts of In deposition giving
  systematic variation of the In composition as a function of average quantum dot
  height and average energy of PL emission.
