abstract: Efficient sources of individual pairs of entangled photons are required
  for quantum networks to operate using fiber-optic infrastructure. Entangled light
  can be generated by quantum dots (QDs) with naturally small fine-structure splitting
  (FSS) between exciton eigenstates. Moreover, QDs can be engineered to emit at standard
  telecom wavelengths. To achieve sufficient signal intensity for applications, QDs
  have been incorporated into one-dimensional optical microcavities. However, combining
  these properties in a single device has so far proved elusive. Here, we introduce
  a growth strategy to realize QDs with small FSS in the conventional telecom band,
  and within an optical cavity. Our approach employs ‘‘droplet-epitaxy’’ of InAs quantum
  dots on (001) substrates. We show the scheme improves the symmetry of the dots by
  72%. Furthermore, our technique is universal, and produces low FSS QDs by molecular
  beam epitaxy on GaAs emitting at ∼900 nm, and metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy
  on InP emitting at ∼1550 nm, with mean FSS 4× smaller than for Stranski-Krastanow
  QDs.
